This directory has some help tools. All of them are optional. 
Normal users can achieve the same results without these. 
They are for internal use and backward compatiblity.

1. check_status.sh

   Usually juju status display a unit in "started" doesn't mean HPCC
   cluster is configured and ready.  This tool check all HPCC components
   are ready to use or not.

   User can check these from ECLWatch web page. It tool is provided
   to command-line process.

   Sample output: 

      CHARM NAME          : hpcc                
      SERVICE NAME        : hpcc                
      UNIT NUMBER         : 3                   
      HPCC Version        : 5.0.0-3             
      Nodes in cluster    : 3                   

      All HPCC processes are running.
      All thor slave nodes are ready.

   "HPCC Version" will indicate expected HPCC package installed or not.
   "Nodes in cluster" will tell if all unit joined in the cluster or not.
   "All HPCC processes are running" means all HPCC configured processes 
       are started.
   "All thor slave nodes are ready" mean all thor slaves are ready to use.
       If big data spread thor slaves will take a while to complete 
       initialization. This checking will help to tell the slaves are fully
       started and ready to use.

2. config_hpcc.sh

   Reconfigure HPCC cluster topology. 
   User can use "juju set <hpcc service> roxie-ratio=<value> thor-ratio=<value>"
   to achieve the same result. This tool just use 'roxie/thor node number' 
   instead of 'ratio'.

   Sample usage:
   To show current configuration:
       ./config_hpcc.sh -list
   
   To reconfigure HPCC cluster with different roxie/thor nodes:
       ./config_hpcc.sh -roxienodes <new value> -thornodes <new value>

3. get_url.sh
  
   Get ECLWatch URL.
   Current implementation will alwasy use the first <hpcc service> unit as
   ESP node. So the ECLWatch ip will the first <hpcc service> unit public
   ip. The port will be 8010 unless re-configured with configure manager
   which is for more advanced configuration. 

4. parse_config.py/parse_status.py

   These are help scripts for above tools.
